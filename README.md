# What is PoltergeistAttack?

## How does PoltergeistnAttack work?

# Simulation Evaluation

## Blur moodel
  Adversarial blurry images are generated by our blur model with public autonomous driving image datasets as input. Our blur model can be used as a function in `blur.py`

## Datasets
  We use two autonomous driving datasets BDD100K and KITTI in the simulation evaluation. For both datasets, we randomly select 200 images for evaluation.
  The pictures that we selected 

## Object Detectors
  We evaluate PG attacks using four academic object detectors YOLO V3/V4/V5 and Faster R-CNN
